# Project Description

Overview

In today's digital world, sensitive information is frequently shared in various forms, such as legal documents, medical records, and emails. To protect personal data and comply with privacy standards, redacting sensitive information from such documents is critical. Manual redaction, however, is time-consuming and costly. This project, The Redactor, leverages modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the redaction process, offering a customizable, efficient solution to detect and redact sensitive information in plain text documents.

Key Features

The Redactor allows users to define which types of sensitive information to censor, including names, dates, phone numbers, addresses, and even broader concepts like "kids" or "prison." The tool is capable of processing various document types (police reports, court transcripts, etc.) and efficiently identifies and censors specified sensitive entities.


# How to install
Ensure you have pipenv installed otherwise install it using the following command.

```
pip install pipenv
```
The following command can also be used.

```
pipenv install -e
```

## How to run

To run the project, execute the following command after activating the pipenv environment:

```
pipenv run python redactor.py --input '*.txt' \
                    --names --dates --phones --address\
                    --concept 'kids' \
                    --output 'files/' \
                    --stats stderr
```
An example command for running the project:

```
pipenv run python redactor.py --input '*.txt' \
                    --names --dates --phones --address\
                    --concept 'Goal' \
                    --output 'files/' \
                    --stats stderr

```
This will download the incident PDF, extract the data, store it in a SQLite database, and print a summary of the incident types and their occurrences.


To run the test cases, execute the following command:
```
pipenv run python -m pytest
```


## Functions

1. **`merge_overlapping_spans(spans)`**
   - Merges overlapping or adjacent character spans to create continuous redaction spans without gaps.

2. **`redact_sentences_with_concepts(text, concepts)`**
   - Identifies sentences containing specified concepts (themes) for redaction, such as "kids" or "prison."

3. **`redact_entities_spacy(text, targets, stats)`**
   - Uses SpaCyâ€™s NER pipeline to detect and redact entities (e.g., names, dates) according to specified targets.

4. **`redact_entities_hf(text, targets, stats)`**
   - Uses a Hugging Face NER model to detect and redact entities in the text, including names and locations.

5. **`redact_email_text(text, targets, stats)`**
   - Extracts and redacts names found in email headers and addresses in the text to ensure sensitive information is removed.

6. **`redact_entities_regex(text, targets, stats)`**
   - Uses regular expressions to identify and redact entities such as names, phone numbers, dates, and addresses.

7. **`output_redaction_stats(stats, destination)`**
   - Outputs redaction statistics, including counts of each type of redaction, to the specified destination (e.g., `stderr`, `stdout`, or a file).

8. **`process_text_file(file_path, args, stats)`**
   - Handles the redaction process for a single text file, including reading the file, applying redactions, and writing the censored content to an output file.

9. **`main()`**
   - Parses command-line arguments, initializes stats, creates output directories, and processes each input file according to the provided flags and options.

## Test Cases

The test suite is organized to validate individual functionalities in the redactor system, such as merging overlapping redaction spans, redacting specific types of sensitive information (names, dates, phones, addresses), and handling concepts for broader redaction purposes. Each test case targets a specific function or redaction type, verifying correct detection, processing, and statistical tracking of redacted items. This ensures that the redactor accurately censors sensitive content across different inputs and formats, with tests for both successful processing and error handling to maintain reliability and robustness.

The tests are located in the tests/ directory, and each function is tested individually. You can run all the tests using pytest, and each function has been tested with both normal inputs and edge cases.

### 1. `test_merge_overlapping_spans.py`
   - **Purpose**: Tests the merging logic for overlapping, adjacent, and mixed spans in text.
   - **Goal**: Ensures that overlapping spans are merged correctly to prevent redundant redaction, maintaining the integrity of the final redacted text.

### 2. `test_output_redaction_stats.py`
   - **Purpose**: Verifies the accurate output of redaction statistics.
   - **Goal**: Checks that the counts of redacted entities (names, dates, phones, etc.) are output to `stdout`, `stderr`, or a file as specified. Ensures comprehensive and error-free reporting of statistics.

### 3. `test_process_text_file.py`
   - **Purpose**: Simulates the redaction of a sample text file.
   - **Goal**: Tests the end-to-end process, ensuring that the file is read, redacted, and written correctly. Also verifies proper error handling, especially for write permissions, with clear error reporting.

### 4. `test_redact_email_text.py`
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on redacting names in email headers (e.g., "From", "To" fields).
   - **Goal**: Confirms that names in email fields are correctly detected and redacted, with accurate updating of redaction statistics.

### 5. `test_redact_entities_hf.py`
   - **Purpose**: Tests entity redaction using a mocked Hugging Face NER pipeline.
   - **Goal**: Validates the Hugging Face model's integration with the redactor for redacting entities like names and locations, ensuring accurate detection, redaction, and stats.

### 6. `test_redact_entities_regex.py`
   - **Purpose**: Tests regex-based redaction functionality for names, phones, dates, and addresses.
   - **Goal**: Ensures regex patterns match sensitive information correctly, redacting accurately while maintaining consistent statistics and output.

### 7. `test_redact_entities_spacy.py`
   - **Purpose**: Tests the SpaCy-based redactor across various entity types.
   - **Goal**: Verifies SpaCy's capability to accurately redact names, dates, and addresses. Tests both individual and combined entity redaction, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

### 8. `test_redact_sentences_with_concepts.py`
   - **Purpose**: Verifies the redaction of sentences containing specific concepts (e.g., themes like "kids" or "prison").
   - **Goal**: Tests for concept redaction with cases of single and multiple concepts, case insensitivity, multi-sentence redaction, and newline-delimited inputs, ensuring accurate redaction and stats.

## Summary
Each test in this suite is designed to ensure the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of the redactor across various types of sensitive information and text structures. By validating entity detection, replacement, and statistics generation, this suite helps maintain robust, reliable, and accurate redaction performance across a wide range of document types and content.

## Bugs and Assumptions
Multiple Line Cells: In some cases, cells (like location or nature) may span multiple lines. The code handles this by merging lines that do not start with a new record's date.

PDF Formatting: The Norman Police Department might change the PDF format at any time. The code currently assumes that the format remains consistent (fields are always in the same order).

Network Issues: The project does not currently handle network-related errors, such as the URL being unreachable or the file being moved/removed from the Norman PD website.
